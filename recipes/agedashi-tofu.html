    <h1>Agedashi Tofu</h1>
    <img src="../img/agedashi.png" width="500px">
    <p>Agedashi tofu is a delightful Japanese dish that has gained popularity for its unique texture and flavor. It consists of cubes of soft tofu that are lightly dusted with potato starch and then deep-fried until they have a subtly crisp exterior. The tofu is then served in a hot broth made of dashi, mirin, and soy sauce, which complements the delicate taste of the tofu. Garnished with finely chopped green onions, grated daikon, and sometimes bonito flakes, it's a dish that balances simplicity with depth of flavor. The contrast between the crispy outside and the soft, almost custard-like inside of the tofu makes agedashi tofu a favorite appetizer at many Japanese restaurants. Whether enjoyed at a bustling izakaya or made at home with care, agedashi tofu is a testament to the versatility and understated elegance of tofu in Japanese cuisine.</p>
