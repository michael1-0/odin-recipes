    <h1>Japanese Curry</h1>
    <img src="./japanesecurry.png">
    <p>Japanese curry, known as 'Kare' in Japan, is a beloved dish that has been warming hearts and bellies across the country for over a century. It's a rich, thick sauce brimming with tender chunks of meat and soft vegetables like onions, carrots, and potatoes. Unlike its Indian counterpart, Japanese curry has a sweeter taste and a milder heat, making it a family-friendly meal that's deeply satisfying. The secret to its distinct flavor lies in the curry roux, a blend of spices and ingredients that can be homemade or bought pre-made for convenience. Whether it's a classic Chicken Katsu Curry topped with a crispy chicken cutlet or a simple yet hearty beef and vegetable curry, each variation offers a comforting taste of Japanese home cooking.</p>
